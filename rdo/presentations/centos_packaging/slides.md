## Me

* OpenStack Community Liaison, RDO project

* RDOProject.org

note: This is a fancy way of saying that I try to make the right
connections between OpenStack, RedHat, RDO, and the general Open
Source public.

---

## OpenStack

* Software for creating a private cloud infrastructure.
* OpenStack.org

---

## OpenStack

* Consists of at least 5 components
  * Compute
  * Identity
  * Network
  * Storage
  * Dashboard

### And up to 20 others

### Complicated, and can be difficult to deploy

---

## OpenStack Distros

* OpenStack, like most Open Source projects, releases source code
* Third-party projects produce distributions for installation
  * RDO (Red Hat)
  * DevStack (OpenStack community)
  * Helion (HP)
  * Fuel (Mirantis)
* Most include both packages and an installation mechanism

note: DevStack is best suited to test - deploys directly out of a git
branch.

note: Attend my Intro to OpenStack on Sunday for more detail on OpenStack

---

## RDO

* "RPM Distro of OpenStack"
* Sponsored by Red Hat
* Established April 2013
* Produces packages for CentOS (and other RPM-based distros)
* packstack, puppet scripts to install and configure OpenStack

note: Yes, it's a boring name. Engineers aren't know for being great at
naming things.

---

## RDO

* A community of people who use and support OpenStack on CentOS
* Documentation at http://rdoproject.org/
* Answer questions on http://ask.openstack.org/ both generally about
  OpenStack, and specific to RDO
